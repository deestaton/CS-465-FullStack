# CS-465-FullStack
CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Architecture
The Travlr project was developed using the MEAN stack, which is a bundle of different programming technologies comprised of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on the client-side to create the user interface and experience (UI/UX). On the server-side, Express HTML is used to simplify the process of rendering HTML views to the client. A Single-Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates parts of the page as users interact with the application. This creates fast load times and a seamless user experience. MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like format. MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured, and unstructured data. The backend of Travlr uses a NoSQL MongoDB database because of its flexibility, ability to scale, performance, and its ease of use when working with the same data between the front- and back-end.

## Functionality
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. It is used to tie together the frontend and backend development pieces by providing a standardized way to format object data that can be easily read by JavaScript to form it into a literal JavaScript object. JSON is not the same as JavaScript, but it is a text format that is derived from a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language. JSON is a way to store and transmit data, while JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to create and control dynamic website content.
