# CS-465-FullStack
CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Architecture
The Travlr project was developed using the MEAN stack, which is a bundle of different programming technologies comprised of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on the client-side to create the user interface and experience (UI/UX). On the server-side, Express HTML is used to simplify the process of rendering HTML views to the client. A Single-Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates parts of the page as users interact with the application. This creates fast load times and a seamless user experience. 

MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like format. MongoDB makes it easy for developers to easily add and remove fields without having to modify the associated schema.
